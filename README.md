## About Morfgen

This is a small side project that aims to help creatives to generate large volumes of random vocab
based on consistent rulesets. I am creating it because I have an interest in linguistics and constructed
languages. Feel free to use this code for any of your own ends.

## Usage and Installation

This project is in very early stages and currently only works from CLI. Currently, the script prompts
you to enter consonant and vowel inventories and a pattern for word generation. I will soon add many
more features that allow for custom subpatterns, weighting and optionality. I will also add a GUI
for DOM down the line. To install copy the module.py and run the script locally.
